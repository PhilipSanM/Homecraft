# Homecraft
HomeCraft is an AI-driven project that allows users to capture a video of their room, extract key frames, segment objects, apply inpainting, and generate a fully editable 3D model of their space. The goal is to enable seamless virtual home redesigns without physically modifying the real-world environment.
